<p>Sara got her start in biomedical research and then entered a PhD program at Boston University in computational neuroscience, working in a speech and language lab as part of a NSF Center of Excellence for the Science of Learning. Her work applied machine learning models to the study of the human brain and applied knowledge of neuroscience to ML model development and neural networks research.  Sara left academia to work as a data scientist at an AdTech startup, where her projects included a recommender system to find target audiences and a machine learning engine to predict ad auctions and automate decisions about ad campaign spending.  She then joined MassMutual and developed underwriting models to predict mortality and automate risk class assignments, and started organizing the Boston Data Science Meetup. With over 10 years of experience in data science, Sara now heads the Cybersecurity and Analytics Data Science team at MassMutual, where we build data science and analytics solutions to help MassMutual lead the industry in cyber resilience and earn consumer trust.</p>
