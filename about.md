<p>Sara Saperstein came to data science from an academic background in computational neuroscience. She earned a B.A. in Biology from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where she studied the neural encoding of taste perception and wrote a thesis on synaptic neurophysiology. After working as a research assistant at Oregon Health and Science University in biomedical engineering she was accepted at Boston University to study computational neuroscience in the department of Cognitive and Neural Systems. For her first dissertation project she used used machine learning and graph theoretic tools on resting-state fMRI to classify ADHD diagnosis in children. For her second dissertation project she clustered multivariate time series of high density EEG to find signatures of brain networks from this less invasive method. During her time in the program Sara served a year as president of the student organization and a semester on the university curriculum committee.</p>

<p>Sara then left academia and became a data scientist at Pixability.  At Pixability we have a wealth of social media and advertising data that we analyze with powerful technical tools to develop strategic algorithms for our product.  As a senior data scientist at Pixability I work on proofs of concept with feedback from team members and other stakeholders to contribute to the intellectual property of the company.</p>
